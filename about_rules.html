TDS Flair
Posts & Comments
Reported as: TDS Flair
As the Ethos of r/Trump is to allow opinions from all over the political spectrum to participate in our comments, we often encounter those who are delusional and obsessed with hating President Trump. In an effort to continue allowing them to participate (largely to allow them to embarrass themselves) yet still alert our community to their toxicity, we set them up with a TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) Flair. Please report anyone deserving of the TDS Flair.
